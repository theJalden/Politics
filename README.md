Politics
========
A game, inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization, but with a heavier focus on operating your nation within the rules of that nation.

Differences
-----------
You cannot deny that in Civilization, no matter what culture you choose, the government in which you operate is always the same: a dictatorship, with you at the top.

This project seeks to implement a more realistic system of government into the game. For example, in Civilization you can move around military forces without objection from anyone. In this game, an anti-war senator or the like may try and stop you by launching a smear campaign or something similar. This would hurt your attempts at the war.

Planned Features
----------------
The trajectory for this project is still very unknown. It's really just something for me to cut my teeth on, so it may undergo radical changes. Perhaps I will fork FreeCiv, or something. At any rate, there won't be a GUI for a long while. If and when that happens, I'll almost certainly port over to Java or C++. The Python is really just here to do what it's best at: being a platform for rapid development and prototyping. Or, perhaps it will all just become a mod for Civ V.
